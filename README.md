## Features

# Services Section

The services section showcases available bookings and allows the user to filter these bookings by location, minimum and maximum price. These bookings were paginated by 6 to show a good amount of content on all screen sizes.

# Navbar

The Navbar allows the user to see all the links to the information with descriptive titles so that the user knows where the link will take them. These were made as simple as possible while also allowing the user to know what information they will gain by using the link.

# Profiles

There is a few profile pages. Firstly, using the navbar link Login. You are able to login to an account and new users are able to register if they do not have an account. These can also be accessed by an unauthorised user if they use the click on the profile image in the center of the navbar. When the user is logged in and they are authorised then their own bookings can be accessed using the profile image. The user is shown information on their current booking and they are able to cancel or update them. When the user would like to logout then they are able to do so by using the logout navbar link that shows when the user is authenticated.
